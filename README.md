Here is a desensitized demo of how we use the image files downloaded from sendbird.

In our code, we first download by the url(sample: https://file-ap-9.sendbird.com/2379d8b0e3f3445f92ff80b89d550e9c.jpg), and then use sizeOf from 'image-size' package to get the dimensions of the image. 

failed-image is the one with issues on our side, and started from Apr 19, 2023, 10:00:00 PM(UTC). previous-uploaded file is the image file we uploaded before, and it went all good with our jpg buffer validation.
